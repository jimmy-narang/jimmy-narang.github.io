title: "When Sharing isn't Believing"
subtitle: "Experimental evidence on coarse messaging and belief-formation in fake news."
description: "People frequently share stories on social media with little additional context. I explore how this type of coarse messaging biases receivers’ beliefs about the veracity of stories forwarded to them. Using a set of lab experiments in India with ~800 pairs of real-life friends, I collect detailed information on how individuals (sharers) decide which stories to forward, and how their friends (receivers) update their beliefs in response. I find that receivers over-interpret the act of forwarding a story as a sign of its veracity and discount other reasons for sharing. As a result, receivers’ beliefs increase in forwarded stories irrespective of the sharers’ belief in them, with larger increases among false stories. By comparing receivers’ updates on learning the sharer’s decisions to their updates on (i) learning the sharer’s beliefs directly, and (ii) learning computer-generated signals of fixed accuracy, I find several mechanisms that contribute to this aggregate bias: receivers overestimate how well their friends’ beliefs correlate with a story’s veracity; mispredict how beliefs translate into sharing decisions; and update in non-Bayesian ways such that their largest updates occur at lowest priors. I conclude with counterfactual exercises to identify the relative value of targeting each mechanism."
