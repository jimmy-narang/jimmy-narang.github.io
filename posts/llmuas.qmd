title: "Trends in the Usage of Large Language Models in the United States"
subtitle: "Evidence from UAS data"
description: "Using a nationally representative panel (N ~ 15,000), we conducted two waves of surveys to track awareness, usage, and perceptions of large language models (LLMs) in the United States. Our data capture longitudinal usage not just by demographics and occupations but also by personal traits and preferences. We find that by Spring 2024, 24% of U.S. residents had used LLMs, and another 48% were aware of them, compared to 18% and 50.5%, respectively, in Fall 2023. LLM Usage was significantly higher among young men, Whites and Asians, those with income above $100,000, college education, analytical occupations, Democrats, and individuals above median in cognitive ability, internet skills, and openness to new experiences; with gaps relatively stable over time. Reasons for LLM usage shifted (within users): work- and school-related applications increased, while curiosity- and entertainment-driven usage declined. Those using LLMs for work were 11 percentage points more likely to engage frequently (daily or weekly) and sustained this higher usage over time. These findings provide a dynamic view of LLM adoption across socio-demographic groups, highlighting persistent disparities and emerging inequalities in AI engagement."
