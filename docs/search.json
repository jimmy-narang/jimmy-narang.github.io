How much should they believe it for that reason? To answer these questions I conduct a series of lab experiments in India with ~800 pairs of real-life friends. Using a custom platform, I collect detailed information on how individuals (sharers) decide which stories to share, and how their friends (receivers) update their beliefs in response. I find receivers over-interpret sharing as a sign of a story’s veracity and the sharer’s faith in it, while discounting other reasons/motivations for sharing. As a result, receivers’ trust in shared stories increases irrespective of the sharers’ belief in them, with false stories accruing the greatest additional trust. To understand why, I measure how receivers’ update if they (i) observe the sharer’s beliefs about these stories (instead of sharing decisions), and (ii) observe computer-generated signals of fixed accuracy (instead of subjective signals from their friend). I find several mechanisms contribute to receivers’ biased inference: receivers overestimate how well sharers’ beliefs predict a story’s veracity; miscalculate the relevance of sharers’ beliefs to sharing decisions; and exhibit base-rate neglect, updating the most on stories they least trusted originally.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 28, 2024\n\n\nJimmy Narang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute Income Mobility in the United States, 1915-1940\n\n\n\nInequality\n\n\nIncome mobility\n\n\nWorking paper\n\n\n\nWe use two newly digitized historical datasets to estimate rates of absolute income mobility for the cohort of sons born in the early 1910s in the United States.

The rates are similar to men born in the United States in the 1980s, suggesting that today’s young adults face mobility prospects comparable to those of adults entering the labor market during the Great Depression.

Increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the rates experienced by children born in the 1940s. However, distributing current GDP growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 birth cohort would reverse more than 70% of the decline in mobility.

But what happens when these biases (i) align or (ii) conflict with each other? By combining data from existing studies with new experiments, I find that confirmation bias is first-order, and mediates the extent to which desirability bias occurs. Subjects’ beliefs show almost no movement upon receiving news that confirms their priors, irrespective of its favorability to their ego or politics. However, subjects update their beliefs considerably upon receiving disconfirming (surprising) news, with larger updates on favorable news.\n\n\n\n\n\nJimmy Narang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluating Satyameva Jayate: A digital literacy program to reduce misinformation among high school students\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Networks\n\n\nBelief Formation\n\n\nIn Progress\n\n\n\nIn partnership with the government of Kerala (India), this randomized study will evaluate the effectiveness of a digital literacy program to reduce the spread of misinformation among high school students.
