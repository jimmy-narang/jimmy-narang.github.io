I explore how this type of coarse messaging biases receivers’ beliefs about the veracity of stories forwarded to them. Using a set of lab experiments in India with ~800 pairs of real-life friends, I collect detailed information on how individuals (sharers) decide which stories to forward, and how their friends (receivers) update their beliefs in response. I find that receivers over-interpret the act of forwarding a story as a sign of its veracity and discount other reasons for sharing. As a result, receivers’ beliefs increase in forwarded stories irrespective of the sharers’ belief in them, with larger increases among false stories. By comparing receivers’ updates on learning the sharer’s decisions to their updates on (i) learning the sharer’s beliefs directly, and (ii) learning computer-generated signals of fixed accuracy, I find several mechanisms that contribute to this aggregate bias: receivers overestimate how well their friends’ beliefs correlate with a story’s veracity; mispredict how beliefs translate into sharing decisions; and update in non-Bayesian ways such that their largest updates occur at lowest priors.

We find that the mobility for this cohort was 30-50 percentage points lower than for the 1940 cohort, a finding robust to alternative income imputations, inflation indices and age adjustments. The rates are similar to men born in the United States in the 1980s, suggesting that today’s young adults face mobility prospects comparable to those of adults entering the labor market during the Great Depression.

Increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the rates experienced by children born in the 1940s. However, distributing current GDP growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 birth cohort would reverse more than 70% of the decline in mobility.

But what happens when these biases (i) align or (ii) conflict with each other? By combining data from existing studies with new experiments, I find that confirmation bias is first-order, and mediates the extent to which desirability bias occurs. Subjects’ beliefs show almost no movement upon receiving news that confirms their priors, irrespective of its favorability to their ego or politics. However, subjects update their beliefs considerably upon receiving disconfirming (surprising) news, with larger updates on favorable news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJimmy Narang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluating Satyameva Jayate: A digital literacy program to reduce misinformation among high school students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Networks\n\n\nBelief Formation\n\n\nIn Progress\n\n\n\n\nIn partnership with the government of Kerala (India), this randomized study will evaluate the effectiveness of a digital literacy program to reduce the spread of misinformation among high school students.

We plan to introduce new curriculum and treatments in addition to evaluating the program’s current version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJimmy Narang, Mir Mohammed Ali\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
