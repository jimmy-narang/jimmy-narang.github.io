How much should they believe it for that reason? To answer these questions we conduct a series of lab experiments in India with ~800 pairs of real-life friends. Using a custom platform, we collect detailed information on how individuals (sharers) decide which stories to share, and how their friends (receivers) update their beliefs in response. We find receivers over-interpret sharing as a sign of a story’s veracity, while discounting other reasons/motivations for sharing. As a result, receivers’ trust in shared stories increases irrespective of the sharers’ belief in them, with false stories accruing the greatest additional trust. To identify mechanisms, we measure how receivers update if, instead of observing their friend’s decisions they (i) learn their friend’s beliefs, and (ii) receive computer-generated clues of known accuracy (instead of subjective signals from their friend). We find several mechanisms contribute to receivers’ biased inference: receivers overestimate how well sharers’ beliefs predict a story’s veracity; miscalculate the relevance of those beliefs to sharing decisions; and exhibit base-rate neglect, updating the most on stories they least believed originally.\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 7, 2024\n\n\nJimmy Narang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute Income Mobility in the United States, 1915-1940\n\n\n\nInequality\n\n\nIncome mobility\n\n\nWorking paper\n\n\n\nWe use two newly digitized historical datasets to estimate rates of absolute income mobility for the cohort of sons born in the early 1910s in the United States.

The rates are similar to men born in the United States in the 1980s, suggesting that today’s young adults face mobility prospects comparable to those of adults entering the labor market during the Great Depression.

Increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the rates experienced by children born in the 1940s.

But what happens when these biases (i) align or (ii) conflict with each other? By combining data from existing studies with new experiments, I find that confirmation bias is first-order, and mediates the extent to which desirability bias occurs. Subjects’ beliefs show almost no movement upon receiving news that confirms their priors, irrespective of its favorability to their ego or politics. However, subjects update their beliefs considerably upon receiving disconfirming (surprising) news, with larger updates on favorable news.\n\n\n\n\n\nJimmy Narang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrends in the Usage of Large Language Models in the United States\n\n\nEvidence from UAS data\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\nLLM\n\n\nInequality\n\n\nIn Progress\n\n\n\nUsing a nationally representative panel (N ~ 15,000), we conducted two waves of surveys to track awareness, usage, and perceptions of large language models (LLMs) in the United States. Our data capture longitudinal usage not just by demographics and occupations but also by personal traits and preferences. We find that by Spring 2024, 24% of U.S. residents had used LLMs, and another 48% were aware of them, compared to 18% and 50.5%, respectively, in Fall 2023. LLM Usage was significantly higher among young men, Whites and Asians, those with income above $100,000, college education, analytical occupations, Democrats, and individuals above median in cognitive ability, internet skills, and openness to new experiences, with gaps relatively stable over time. Reasons for LLM usage shifted within users: work- and school-related applications increased, while curiosity- and entertainment-driven usage declined. Those using LLMs for work were 11 percentage points more likely to engage frequently (daily or weekly) and remain frequent users. These findings provide a dynamic view of LLM adoption across socio-demographic groups, highlighting persistent disparities and emerging inequalities in AI engagement.\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 1, 2024\n\n\nMarco Angrisani, Maria Cassanova, Nathanael Fast, Jimmy Narang, Juliana Schroeder\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
