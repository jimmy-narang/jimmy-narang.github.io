- title: "Priors vs. Desires: what happens when biases interact"
  author: Jimmy Narang
  description: "A long literature in psychology and economics documents that people update their beliefs in a biased manner upon receiving news that agrees with their priors (confirmation bias) or their desires (motivated updating / desirability bias). But what happens when these biases (i) align or (ii) conflict with each other? By combining data from existing studies with new experiments, I find that confirmation bias is first-order, and mediates the extent to which desirability bias occurs. Subjects' beliefs show almost no movement upon receiving news that confirms their priors, irrespective of its favorability to their ego or politics. However, subjects update their beliefs considerably upon receiving disconfirming (surprising) news, with larger updates on favorable news."
