- title: "Priors vs. Desires: what happens when biases interact"
  author: Jimmy Narang
  description: "A long literature in psychology and economics documents that people update their beliefs in a biased manner upon receiving news that agrees with their priors (confirmation bias) or their desires (motivated updating / desirability bias). But what happens when these biases (i) align or (ii) conflict with each other? By combining data from existing studies with new experiments, I find that confirmation bias is first-order, and mediates the extent to which desirability bias occurs. Subjects' beliefs show almost no movement upon receiving news that confirms their priors, irrespective of its favorability to their ego or politics. However, subjects update their beliefs considerably upon receiving disconfirming (surprising) news, with larger updates on favorable news."

- title: "Trends in the Usage of Large Language Models in the United States"
  subtitle: "Evidence from UAS data"
  description: "Using a nationally representative panel (N ~ 15,000), we conducted two waves of surveys to track awareness, usage, and perceptions of large language models (LLMs) in the United States. Our data capture longitudinal usage not just by demographics and occupations but also by personal traits and preferences. We find that by Spring 2024, 24% of U.S. residents had used LLMs, and another 48% were aware of them, compared to 18% and 50.5%, respectively, in Fall 2023. LLM Usage was significantly higher among young men, Whites and Asians, those with income above $100,000, college education, analytical occupations, Democrats, and individuals above median in cognitive ability, internet skills, and openness to new experiences, with gaps relatively stable over time. Reasons for LLM usage shifted within users: work- and school-related applications increased, while curiosity- and entertainment-driven usage declined. Those using LLMs for work were 11 percentage points more likely to engage frequently (daily or weekly) and remain frequent users. These findings provide a dynamic view of LLM adoption across socio-demographic groups, highlighting persistent disparities and emerging inequalities in AI engagement."
