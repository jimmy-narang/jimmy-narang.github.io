## About

I am a microeconomist with broad interests in Behavioral Economics and Economic Development. I use lab/field experiments to answer questions about:

1. Social norms, social networks, and belief-formation;
2. Persistent inequalities of income, opportunity or power.

Starting Aug 2023, I'll be a Postdoc at the [Psychology of Technology Institute](https://www.psychoftech.org/) and [Neely Center](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/institutes-and-centers/neely-center-for-ethical-leadership-and-decision-making) at the University of Southern California.

## Note

I'm actively seeking collaborators for new projects. Please write to me if any of the the topics below (or the themes above) interest you:

- Relationships between domestic workers and their employers in India
- Generative AI and the manual work ([often by workers in low/middle income countries](https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots)) that goes into producing it.
